# bronze: factor semiprimes with pi

`bronze` is a cheap math gag: "factor" semiprimes by simply dividing them by pi and collecting the real-valued result. It's not particularly illuminating.

# EXAMPLES

```console
$ bronze
42.0
(3.141592653589793, 13.36901521971921)
6.0
(3.141592653589793, 1.909859317102744)
143.0
(3.141592653589793, 45.518313724282066)
```

# BUILD

```console
$ make
```
